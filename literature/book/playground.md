The window reflected the darkness engulfing the world around. The front door shattered through. The house filled through the cold, freezing breath of God. The wind touched every fiber of my existence. I stood embracing His magnificence. 

“For christ’s sake, get into the car”

It all came down fast, the ever rising water swallowed through the door, it rose through the magnifying storm. The clouds sobbed through a shriek.

“WE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME”
		    “It is the end, we have to go, we have to run!”

We needed to run, they needed to run. Who would betray God.

“Listen, listen, LISTEN! It is not the time, really not the time

The windows splashed with a crashing shield of His desire. The ground saw its goosebumps, the trees flew to Him. The sky walked away, let the dark circles be the new lover of the ever greying earth.  The world was walking away, my world. How could I not be with them, how could they not have been with me. 

“Love, please, please, plead with me. Walk with me. We cannot, your father is here, we need to get out. The world is ending, it is not our place to watch it be engulfed by the devil. Sweetie, please, please”,

Her hands touched my arms softly. I could see my dad sitting in the car, watching us, with some longing in his eyes, a longing for me? For the good lives we all were promised by this world? This reality? Tears slowly stirred through her cheek, with the clouds, His ever servant of His domain, draining out its expansive sea within its bones. Mom was there, Dad was there, one moment, the next I saw His hands holding them down. Taking back what rightfully was His. Taking my parents to His, taking back His toys. I am not allowed to play with them anymore. I could hear some part of the house shattering under the growing weight of the wind. I would hear the deaths of many around the world, the birds sang low, the people sang louder, and, and, and, and what did I do? Why did He not take me, why was I spared, a toy forgotten in the yard. Sweeped away in the morning, lost for the ever coming days. Forgotten, empty, dirty, forgotten in the end of times, forgotten in the world after.
