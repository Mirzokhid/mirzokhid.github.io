                <h1 class="heading">The Sarah Book</h1>
                <p class="for_text">I am tired of the cries of my thoughts, the empty screams of a soul that has long given up on the essence of nature. I am of but yet. I am yet but now. </p>
                <p class="for_text">Would you allow your worst moment, the worst era of your essence, to be a public identity? Unpack your elaborate destruction as a human to the world, and become the psychological equivalent to madness for a book. Would you allow yourself to become a human, by posing your humanity as un-human?</p>
                <p class="for_text">It is a question the novel The Sarah Book by Scott McClanahan uncovers. And by uncovering I mean relinquishing the choice for privacy and putting his divorce as an exposure behind the story. The novel follows Scott’s, yes the author himself, divorce from his now ex-wife Sarah. A very nuanced and emotionally drenching expose. The novel, even though it is hard to read from all the catastrophic secondhand sadness and embarrassment you feel for Scott, is a question of how much emotions mere words can make you feel. And I am not speaking of melancholy spits of prose, but a wave of anger, happiness, frustration, and a deep realisation of what it means to be at the bottom. </p>
                <p class="for_text">I would critique the novel’s inability to sustain a healthy progression of events, or as biblical creationists would put it - ‘an excuse to untie human existence from the planet we own’. It is the complete detachment of Scott's behaviour from rational, or even irrational, choice of actions that puts the novel in its place of emotional inability. The novel is unable to create stories that attach the reader’s views and desires to it - a usually expected and wanted outcome from any novel. It is a flaw that many point out, and it is a flaw I believe is unfaithfully judged. This saint of a flaw is what allows the book to eat itself out, unfortunately not sexually, and destroy the very existence of what Scott McClanahan was.</p>
                <p class="for_text">	Who are we to choose what our lives are meant to be, who am I to say what my life has allowed me to become? Am I the power of my life, or is my life the idea of my power? I do not want to have control over my life, I do not want to be one to say what my life is meant to be. I am gonna be creating a life that I will regret. </p>
